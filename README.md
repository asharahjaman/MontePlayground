# MontePlayground
Interactive Monte Carlo and game theory simulation toolkit with optimal strategy analysis

What it does: An interactive platform to run Monte Carlo simulations, explore probability paradoxes (Monty Hall, Bertrand’s Box), and find optimal strategies for deterministic games.


Why it matters: Makes abstract probability and game theory concepts tangible and testable, bridging the gap between theory and experiment.


How it’s built: Modular Python backend with simulation engines, game tree search using minimax and alpha-beta pruning, and visualization with Plotly + Streamlit for interactive exploration.
